**Action Definitions:**
- **Pick up OBJECT**: Recognized as complete when the robot's gripper has securely grasped the object, and it is fully suspended in the air with no contact with any surfaces.
- **Put OBJECT into DESTINATION**: Confirmed as complete when the object is inside the destination, and the gripper has retracted, fully releasing the object.

- Check carefully where the object being deposited ends up. Anything that could be trash (like packets) often go into the trash. 
- Plates, bowls, spoons, cups or stuff that we want to keep often goes into the box. For containers, you should check carefully where it is being deposited.
